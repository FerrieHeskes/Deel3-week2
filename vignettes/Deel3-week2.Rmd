This package contains several functions which can be used to get insight of the fatal injuries within the USA, e.g. :

- gives a map of the fatal injuries per state per year
- gives the total injuries within the USA per year per month  

It uses the following external libraries:

dplyr
readr
tidyr
maps
graphics

## Figures

Per state per year a map can be made with all the fatal injuries per year. This by executing e.g. fars_map_state(10,2013) with inputparameters statenumber and year.

## More Examples

Besides showing maps with fatal injuries per state also the total amount of fatal injuries per month per year can be shown, e.g. via 'fars_summarize_years(c(2013,2014))'.
